Hey {{first_name}},

{{generated_joke_opener}}

Anyway, terrible jokes aside...

I'm researching how marketers leverage gifting to creators to create a content machine for paid media campaigns. I'd love to ask your advice to help round out my research & can share some of what I've learned so far. Do you have 10min for a short interview in the next few days?

Hey {{first_name}},

Following up on my own cold email. The audacity.

Genuinely curious if creator/affiliate stuff is on your radar or if I should take the hint.

Hey {{first_name}},

Last one, I promise. After this I'll quietly accept defeat and move on with my life.

If timing's just bad, happy to reconnect later. If it's a "not interested" - totally get it, no hard feelings.

Chris

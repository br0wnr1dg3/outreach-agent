# LEAD GENERATION CONFIG
# =============================================================================
# This config controls the discovery pipeline - finding new leads automatically.
#
# The flow:
# 1. Agent analyzes your SEED CUSTOMERS to understand your ICP
# 2. Generates search keywords based on what those customers have in common
# 3. Searches Facebook Ad Library for advertisers matching those keywords
# 4. Looks up decision makers at those companies via Apollo
# 5. Scores new leads by similarity to your seeds
# 6. Adds qualified leads to your database
#
# START HERE: Add your seed customers below - everything else flows from that.
# =============================================================================

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SEED CUSTOMERS (Required) - Your best existing customers
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the PRIMARY INPUT. Add your best customers here.
#
# The agent uses these to:
# - Analyze their websites, ads, and positioning
# - Identify patterns (what industry, what they sell, company size, etc.)
# - Generate search keywords automatically
# - Score new leads by how similar they are to your winners
#
# Who to include:
# - Customers with high lifetime value
# - Customers who were easy to close
# - Customers who love your product
# - Customers who represent your ideal buyer
#
# The more seeds you add, the better the targeting works.
# Aim for 5-10 seeds minimum.

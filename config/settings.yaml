# OUTREACH SETTINGS
# =============================================================================
# This config controls the email sending pipeline - timing, rate limits, and
# Gmail settings.
# =============================================================================

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SEQUENCE: Timing between emails
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The system sends a 3-email sequence:
#   email_1    -> (wait email_2_delay_days) -> followup_1 -> (wait) -> followup_2
#
# Delays are cumulative from the previous email, not from email_1
sequence:
  # Days to wait after email_1 before sending followup_1
  email_2_delay_days: 3

  # Days to wait after followup_1 before sending followup_2
  # (So 7 days total from email_1 if email_2_delay_days is 3)
  email_3_delay_days: 4

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SENDING: Rate limits to avoid Gmail issues
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Gmail has sending limits. These settings help you stay under them and look
# more human (not a spam bot sending 100 emails per second).
#
# Gmail limits (approximate):
# - Free Gmail: ~100-150 emails/day
# - Google Workspace: ~2000 emails/day (but start slow!)
sending:
  # Maximum emails to send per day
  # Start conservative (20-50) and increase gradually
  daily_limit: 50

  # Random delay between sends (seconds)
  # Makes sending look more natural, not robotic
  min_delay_seconds: 20
  max_delay_seconds: 60

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GMAIL: Your sending identity
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
gmail:
  # Name that appears in the "From" field
  # e.g., "Chris" shows as "Chris <your-email@gmail.com>"
  from_name: "Chris"
